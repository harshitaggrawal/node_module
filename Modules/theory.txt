//? Basic module

module is used to share variable,function and class from one file to another file.
we use to object in module ..
1. exports -> what we want to send from file   
It pass the data into an object
  syntax:  module.exports={
    key:value,
    arr,
    function,
    className
  }
2. imports -> where we want to use exports data 

then it comes into an objecct 

const importObjectOFData=require('path of file ');
then it comes into an object we can use it by destuct into an single single elements 


Note:  those file we are importing then firtly it execute all the code of this file after that it execute another file coode
means we execute  two file from one files..



3. defaults exports


for export 
module.exports={
    default:items
} 


for import 
const items =require('./index').default;

why we use this ?

we use this to pass same as datatype  dont make any object to pass any data we can use simply data 
but if we using then we can pass only one either variable, function or class...


# renaming


//! Export Renameing
module.exports={
    i: items,
    f: testing,
    cl: myclass
 
}


Import renaming
const  {items:i,testing:t,myclass:c}=require('./index');





MODULE -> package  those we can use anywhere in an entire project
means entry point of  node 

1. npm init
2. add a key to use module impost export into module package.json
  "type": "module"  

if we are  using module then we can use import expost as like 

i. export


 export{
     items
      }


 Renaming
export{
    items as i
}

ii. import 

import { i } from "./items.js";  extension of file is important


Renaming
import { i as items  } from "./items.js";


default export

exports default dataname;

import dataname from 'filenme.extension';
